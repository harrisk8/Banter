# Banter

Banter is a geo-centric social media platform for psuedo-anonymous communication for college campuses. I spent about 1.5 years putting this project together, starting out with nothing more than a very ambiguous idea of what I wanted to create.

The platform was built via Swift, Storyboard/SwiftUI, and Firebase.

Banter had made it to final beta testing when, due to competitve pressures, the project was scrapped.
