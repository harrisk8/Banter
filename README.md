# Banter

Banter is a geo-centric social media platform for psuedo-anonymous communication for college campuses. I spent about 1.5 years putting this project together, starting out with nothing more than a very ambiguous idea of what I wanted to create.

I want to emphasize I built this project before I studied data structures/algorithms and higher-level CS topics in depth. Looking back, there's so much in this codebase I would do differently, knowing what I know now.

The platform was built via Swift, Storyboard/SwiftUI, and Firebase.

Banter had made it to final beta testing when, due to competitve pressures, the project was scrapped.
